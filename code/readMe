This folder contains the subfolders: 'Matlab', 'Python', 'and ICA_AROMA_MASKS'.

All Python parts and the 'ICA_AROMA_MASKS' follow the original implementation of ICA-AROMA:
https://github.com/maartenmennes/ICA-AROMA. The only adaptation made here is that the
ICA-AROMA.py and the ICA_AROMA_FUNCTIONS.py scripts are changed to use FSL in windows
subsystem for Linux. This change is only made for the case in which this dataset is run (
2x2x2 mm voxels in MNI space). If you do not use windows subsystem for Linux or you want to
run different parts of the script, it is best to use the original scripts.
